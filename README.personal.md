# Resting Places: Personal Reflection & Deployment Notes

## Why This Project Matters

*Resting Places* is a gentle sanctuary for quiet griefs and everyday losses. It invites users to share tributes in a space that feels emotionally safe, validating, and resonant. This project reflects my commitment to designing digital spaces that center care, clarity, and healing.

## What I Learned

- **Technical Growth**  
  Practiced semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and soft JavaScript interactions. Structured a multipage site with intentional navigation and emotional pacing.

- **Emotional Design**  
  Explored how typography, color, and layout can evoke softness and safety. Every element—from the purple flower favicon to the tribute form—was chosen with care.

- **Deployment Confidence**  
  Successfully deployed via [GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel] *(choose one)*, ensuring accessibility and polish.
