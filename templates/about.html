   <h1>About Resting Places</h1>
<p>This project was born from a quiet ache—the kind that doesn’t always have words. It’s a space to honor the invisible, the unspoken, the deeply felt.</p>

<p>We believe that small griefs matter. That naming them is an act of care. That sharing them is an act of courage.</p>

<p>Resting Places is built with emotional safety in mind. No comments. No judgment. Just space.</p>
